Logic:
1. Say Hello Message
2. Ask user for name
3. Parse for name
4. See if user model exists. If so, load the model
5. Prompt user for command
6. Determine which type of command the user gave (find more about SSDs or buy one)

7a. Buy SSD
- Ask what laptop the user has
- If the user has previously asked for the laptop and a suggested SSD was given, remind the user.
- Google the laptop. Try to find the correct interface / connection. Or use the Crucial website. If nothing is found, warn the user.
- Ask for the budget.
- Maintain a model about what kind of specs the user is looking for ( table content: laptop brand, model, budget, capacity, recommended ssd)
- Ask user to give more details
- Find matches and display
- Allow user to find new SSD for new laptop
