While there's little detail in the announcement about what it’s made of, apart from being ‘pro-grade’ and ‘ultra-rugged’ with ‘premium strength’, we do know it has an aluminum core that acts as a heat-sink to help maintain high speeds.
Even better, that kind of speed allows real-time 4K/8K editing straight from the drive.
There's no mention of it in the announcement, but it’s almost certainly bus-powered too, given that there are no other ports on the drive.
Western Digital has also identified a problem with USB Type-C cables all being identical on the outside, but not on the inside, and has thoughtfully included a cable with the drive that supports both interfaces.
“The new PRO-G40 SSD eliminates the problem we have all experienced before: grabbing the wrong USB-C cable or computer for our Thunderbolt 3 or USB devices,” said Hector Sandoval, vice president of product marketing, pricing and programs at Western Digital.
MSRP is around $480 (£415 in the UK), presumably for the 1TB version.
