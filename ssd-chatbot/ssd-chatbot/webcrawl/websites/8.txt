 Western Digital is introducing a new flagship portable SSD today under the SanDisk Professional brand. The PRO-G40 dual-mode PSSD ticks all the right boxes for prosumers, content creators, and studios looking for a high-performance rugged bus-powered portable storage drive with wide compatibility. 1TB and 2TB versions are available. While the PSSD delivers its maximum performance (close to 3GBps) when connected to Thunderbolt 3 hosts, it can also work as a 1GBps-class drive when connected to a USB 3.2 Gen 2 host port. Western Digital provided us with a 2TB sample of the PRO-G40 to put through our rigorous direct-attached storage evaluation. 
 Introduction 
 External bus-powered storage devices have grown both in storage capacity as well as speeds over the last decade. Thanks to rapid advancements in flash technology (including the advent of 3D NAND and NVMe) as well as faster host interfaces (such as Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.x), we now have palm-sized flash-based storage devices capable of delivering 3GBps+ speeds. While those speeds can be achieved with Thunderbolt 4, mass-market devices have to rely on USB. Within the USB ecosystem, USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) is fast becoming the entry level for thumb drives and portable SSDs. 
 The initial wave of Thunderbolt 3-based portable SSDs and enclosures offered impressive performance, but market acceptance was limited by their incompatibility with traditional USB ports. Intel's Titan Ridge controllers offered an interesting feature when used in client devices such as peripherals and/or docks. In addition to downstream PCIe lanes, an USB 3.2 Gen 2 host interface was also included. This allowed manufacturers to offer unique dual-mode designs by tweaking the traditional JHL7440 Thunderbolt 3 SSD. The USB 3.2 Gen 2 downstream port is connected to the upstream interface of a USB to NVMe bridge chip. Depending on the host to which the drive is connected (reported by the JHL7440), the PCIe 3.0 x4 lanes of the NVMe SSD are connected to either the JHL7440's downstream PCIe 3.0 x4 lanes or the bridge chip's PCIe 3.0 x4 lanes. The  Sabrent ROCKET XTRM-Q  was one of the first PSSD lineups to support dual-mode operation based on this architecture. 
 Western Digital is joining the dual-mode bandwagon today with the SanDisk Professional PRO-G40 Portable SSD. The PSSD uses the WD_BLACK SN750E M.2 2280 drive internally. On the bridge side, the JHL7440 Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3 controller is augmented by the ASMedia ASM2362 USB 3.2 Gen 2 - NVMe bridge chip. The enclosure itself is quite stylish, and is made of solid aluminum. One side is covered by a silicone base. The drive also includes a LED indicator and a metal-reinforced USB-C port. 
 
 These features allow the PRO-G40 to obtain an IP68 rating - complete protection against dust ingress, and no damage resulting from complete and continuous impression under 1m of water. The solid aluminum core allows for drop- (up to 3m) and crush-resistance (up to 4000 lbs.) also, while supporting faster heat dissipation as part of the thermal solution. 
 The PRO-G40 PSSD comes in a minimal package with the main unit and a short 20cm Thunderbolt 3 passive cable. The length could be a concern for typical desktops, but the use-case for these dual-mode drives mostly involves notebooks or systems that utilize a Thunderbolt dock as part of the workspace. 
 
 The drive comes formatted for Macs out of the box, but it is trivial to reformat in one's OS of choice. Our sample was evaluated with the exFAT filesystem on a Windows 10 machine. The 'issues' plaguing all Thunderbolt SSDs on Windows affect the SanDisk Professional PRO-G40 too. Unless write caching is enabled in the volume policies for the Thunderbolt port-connected drive, the write performance doesn't match the expectations / advertised numbers. 
 Our policy is to evaluate all external storage devices with default OS settings - and this has been for quick removal since we moved to Windows 10 on our new testbed. However, we did evaluate the PRO-G40 drive thrice - once connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port, and another time connected to a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port enabled by the ASMedia ASM2342 controller. In our final pass, we repeated the evaluation procedure with the write cache settings modified, as shown in the picture below (default settings on the left, and modified one on the right). 
 
 CrystalDiskInfo provides a quick overview of the PSSD as seen by the host system. The interface section is of particular interest - NVM Express over Thunderbolt, and UASP (NVM Express) over USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C.

 Prior to looking at the benchmark numbers, power consumption, and thermal solution effectiveness, a description of the testbed setup and evaluation methodology is provided. 
 Testbed Setup and Evaluation Methodology 
 Direct-attached storage devices are evaluated using the Quartz Canyon NUC (essentially, the Xeon / ECC version of the  Ghost Canyon NUC ) configured with  2x 16GB DDR4-2667 ECC SODIMMs  and a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD - the  IM2P33E8 1TB  from ADATA. 
 
 The most attractive aspect of the Quartz Canyon NUC is the presence of two PCIe slots (electrically, x16 and x4) for add-in cards. In the absence of a discrete GPU - for which there is no need in a DAS testbed - both slots are available. In fact, we also added a spare SanDisk Extreme PRO M.2 NVMe SSD to the CPU direct-attached M.2 22110 slot in the baseboard in order to avoid DMI bottlenecks when evaluating Thunderbolt 3 devices. This still allows for two add-in cards operating at x8 (x16 electrical) and x4 (x4 electrical). Since the Quartz Canyon NUC doesn't have a native USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port, Silverstone's  SST-ECU06  add-in card was installed in the x4 slot. All non-Thunderbolt devices are tested using the Type-C port enabled by the SST-ECU06. 
 The specifications of the testbed are summarized in the table below:

 Thanks to ADATA, Intel, and SilverStone Tek for the build components 
 
 
 
 The testbed hardware is only one segment of the evaluation. Over the last few years, the typical direct-attached storage workloads for memory cards have also evolved. High bit-rate 4K videos at 60fps have become quite common, and 8K videos are starting to make an appearance. Game install sizes have also grown steadily even in portable game consoles, thanks to high resolution textures and artwork. Keeping these in mind, our evaluation scheme for direct-attached storage devices involves multiple workloads which are described in detail in the corresponding sections.

 WD are mudding the waters a lot with far too many products and far too many occurrences of bait and switch for SKUs. Seems like for now Samsung and Seagate remain "safe" options.

 This is nothing new over the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro I got back in 2020. When are we gonna see an integrated Thunderbolt/USB4 + flash controller, like the Silicon Motion SM2320 is for USB 2x2?

 I mean, it's lovely that they have made this product, but literally the only thing i want to see from WD's protable drive division is a USB4 product that can do full drive capacity writes at speeds greater than that achievable by USB 3.2x2. Make me one of those.

 It’s better to just get a better performing drive such as a sn770 or sn850 or Samsung 980 pro and slap it in a thunderbolt enclosure, such as that made by Acasis, and you will get excellent performance. I’ve been doing this for a couple years now…

 Last I checked there were no enclosures that had USB fallback compatibility though?
