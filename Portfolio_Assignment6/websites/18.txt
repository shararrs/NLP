 The abstract of the patent published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office states: “ A memory system includes a non-volatile memory chip and a controller. The non-volatile memory chip is capable of determining an erase voltage according to a temperature of the non-volatile memory chip and a correction parameter. The controller is configured to update the correction parameter of the non-volatile memory chip according to temperature information related to the temperature of the non-volatile memory chip. The non-volatile memory chip determines the erase voltage according to the temperature of the non-volatile memory chip and the updated correction parameter received from the controller. ” 
 The patent application was filed on September 30, 2020 (17/038,721). 
 Semiconductor storage device that performs verification operation in selective manner 
 Kioxia Corporation, Tokyo, J apan ,  has been assigned a patent ( 11,410,728 ) developed by  Shimura, Yasuhiro, Yokohama Kanagawa, Japan , for   a  “ s emiconductor storage device that performs a verification operation in a selective manner . “ 
 The abstract of the patent published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office states: “ A semiconductor storage device includes first and second memory strings, a word line, first and second select gate lines, and a control circuit. The first memory string includes a first memory transistor and a first select transistor. The second memory string includes a second memory transistor and a second select transistor. The word line is connected to the first and second memory transistors. The control circuit is connected to the word line and the first and second select gate lines. The control circuit is configured to perform, during a write sequence, a program operation on each of the first and second memory transistors in turn and a verify operation on only one of the first and second memory transistors. ” 
 The patent application was filed on August 27, 2020 (17/004,680). 
 Memory system 
 Kioxia Corporation, Tokyo, J apan ,  has been assigned a patent ( 11,410,725 ) developed by  Shirakawa, Masanobu, Chigasaki, Japan, and Takeda, Naomi, Yokohama, Japan , for   a  “ m emory system . “
