 Crystal Group Unveils Ruggedized and Tamper-Proof NVMe M.2 SSD Based on Seagate BarraCuda 515 SSD 
 Meeting DoD cybersecurity, FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified SSD, Common Criteria certification with disk encryption solution, TPG Opal compliant self-encryption, TAA compliant, and block-level data destruction verification 
 
                                    This is a Press Release edited by StorageNewsletter.com on September 29, 2022 at 2:02 pm                                 
 
 
 Crystal Group, Inc.  announced  t he release of a ruggedized and tamper-proof NVMe M.2 drive validated across their portfolio of rugged, high-performance compute solutions for tactical edge applications. 
 Ruggedized NVMe M.2 drives after passing environmental testing  
for salt fog based on MIL-STD-810G1, Method 509.6 requirements 
 
 Using proprietary  company’s  ruggedization techniques on the tamper-evident  Seagate  Technology Holdings plc ’   BarraCuda  515 SSD extends the drive’s capabilities to military platforms by meeting U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity and environmental operating requirements. 
 
 “ Marrying advanced data security features with comprehensive environmental standards streamlines two critical performance needs for tactical edge applications into one solution, ” said Todd Prouty, senior business development manager. “ Integrating these capabilities at both the drive level and hardware level provides maximum physical and data protections for long-life, seamless compute performance and accuracy in and across all domains .” 
 Primary safeguards for sensitive and classified data include:  
 
 
 FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified SSD  
 
 
 Common Criteria certification with full disk encryption solution  
 
 
 TPG Opal compliant self-encryption  
 
 
 TAA compliant  
 
 
 Block-level data destruction verification 
 
 
 In addition to meeting or exceeding common MIL-STD-810 environmental test standards, such as temperature, vibration, shock and humidity, the BarraCuda 515 SSDs profile is also  salt fog  compliant. Salt fog resilience is critical for applications like U.S. Navy deployments, which are exposed to highly corrosive environments.  
 “ Seagate Government Solutions is dedicated to supporting our long-term partnership with Crystal Group. We at SGS see this conformal-coated, secure M.2 device as answering a long-standing requirement in rugged applications for the Government, ” said Mike Moritzkat, CEO and  MD,   Seagate Government Solutions .  
 To address the variety of compute needs across different tactical edge platforms and applications, this rugged, tamper-evident NVMe M.2 drive can be used on any form factor from the company’s portfolio of rugged, performance compute solutions. The firm is a rugged solutions provider to offer this combination of environmental robustness and security protection at the SSD and hardware levels.
